# By_Breed with Tab navigation

## The Dog and Cat tabs switch between dog breeds and cat breeds. Touching a breed name brings you to the Details Screen. However, the details are not rendering and I've spent the last 3 hours trying to figure out how to fix it. The same thing is happening with the by_breed app I built using Stack Navigation. Here is the error message I'm getting for both: 

### VirtualizedList: You have a large list that is slow to update - make sure your renderItem function renders components that follow React performance best practices like PureComponent, shouldComponentUpdate, etc.
